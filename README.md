# DeepestDungeonScripts

The code is part of a student project i have worked on for a masters course at University of Bayreuth.

This project was a cooperative 4 player ability shooter.

I was mainly responsible for implementing core gameplay features, the enemy AI and the Networking with the Photon Library.

All the files in the Messaging folder were created together back then with a fellow student (Carl-Philipp Hellmuth).
